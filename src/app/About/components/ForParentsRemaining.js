            Drop-off takes place at <strong>8:00 AM sharp</strong>. This ensures all children
            can participate in the full dayâ€™s activities without disruption.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Pick-up begins at <strong>3:30 PM</strong>, with children returning home by 
            <strong> 4:00 PM</strong>. Parents are expected to pick up their child no later than 
            <strong> 4:30 PM</strong>.

            On most days, we walk to and from school, allowing children to enjoy fresh air
            and light exercise. In cases of bad weather or necessity, we drive them to 
            and from school.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Late Pick-Ups:** If a parent is running late, please notify us as soon as 
            possible. Consistent late pick-ups may result in additional fees.
